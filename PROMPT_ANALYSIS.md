## How to Use the Optimized Prompts

### Import the new prompts:
```javascript
import { 
  COURSE_OUTLINE_PROMPT,
  NOTES_GENERATION_PROMPT,
  FLASHCARD_GENERATION_PROMPT,
  QUIZ_GENERATION_PROMPT,
  ASSIGNMENT_GENERATION_PROMPT,
  MCQ_GENERATION_PROMPT 
} from '@/configs/OptimizedPrompts';
```

### Update your routes to use them:

**Example for Course Outline:**
```javascript
const PROMPT = COURSE_OUTLINE_PROMPT(topic, courseType, difficultyLevel);
const aiResult = await courseOutlineAIModel.sendMessage(PROMPT);
```

**Example for Notes:**
```javascript
const PROMPT = NOTES_GENERATION_PROMPT(
  chapter.chapter_title,
  chapter.topics,
  difficulty
);
const notes = await generateNotesAiModel.sendMessage(PROMPT);
```
